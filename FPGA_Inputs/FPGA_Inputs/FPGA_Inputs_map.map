WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   TicToc_1/TimeStamp_temp_GND_19_o_AND_27_o2 is sourced by a combinatorial pin.
   This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of
   data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:2410 - This design is using one or more 9K Block RAMs
   (RAMB8BWER).  9K Block RAM initialization data, both user defined and
   default, may be incorrect and should not be used.  For more information,
   please reference Xilinx Answer Record 39999.

  Number of MUXCYs used:                       148 out of   4,556    3%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          244
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            78 out of     244   31%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              66 out of  18,224    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
